 * Infinite scrolling; article listing grabs new links automatically

Status
======
This project is currently in development, and it only at a very early
stage. It *should* work without any hiccups, but nothing is promised at
this point.

It definitely needs graphics work: a new theme that is more HN like (at
the very least orange highlighting instead of default blue), and an
pretty icon.

I am hoping to get a base set of features down solid and then release it
to the market and show it to HackerNews.

Code
====
Some of it's not that great, I know. I'll work on polishing it up as I
get a better grip on functionality.
